# Todo App using - React + TypeScript + Vite

This is a simple application to begin familiarizing myself with React, Typescript and Vite.

The todo app allows users to:

- Create new tasks
- Edit existing tasks (feature not yet included)
- Filter between active states
- Toggle status of tasks
- Delete tasks
- Automatically saves users tasks in local storage
